Java Objectives for the week:
SWBAT(Student will be able to):

	-use Eclipse and set up the basic structure for a project in Eclipse.
	-Understand and write variables using primitive types, conditionals(including Switch Statements), enums, loops, and arrays.
	-Build classes and make objects from those classes.
	-Create Interfaces 
	-Discuss the difference between an Interface and a Class, and have a fundamental understanding of when to use each one. 
	-Exhibit a fundamental grasp on the overarching concepts of Object Oriented Programming through various assessments, 
	including discussion, code, and written assessments.
	
PART I - ALL TOGETHER
1. File -> new -> project
2. Name it Java-151-Primer -> Finish
3. Right click on src.
4. Create a new package. Call it _01_General_Notes
4. Create a new package. Call it _02_Hello_World
5. Click package. New class -> HelloWorld
6. Check public static void box.
7. Create a "Hello World" using System.out.println

/************************************************************************************/
PART II - WITH A PARTNER or INDIVIDUALLY
	1. Set up a repo on Github for the project. 
	2. Push your project with "Hello World" to the repo. 

	TIPS:
		You might want to set up a practice repo first. This will be a repo that you can immediately delete, if needed.
		Be sure that you are in the correct directory before you initialize the repo.
		Take your time. 
		Review notes from last week.
		Ask us for help. We will. 
		Github gives you a few notes to follow when you start a new repo.

PART III - LAB WITH A PARTNER/INDIVIDUALLY

Here's how the structure of your project will look.
>Java_Library
	>src
		>_01_General Notes
			_00_Eclipse_Notes.txt
				-> TODO: Figure out how to change the background in Eclipse. Put a note in this file that tells how to do it.
				-> TODO: Figure out how to see and use a TODO List in Eclipse. Put a note on how to do it.
				-> TODO: Start figuring out a few common shortcuts and start making a list in this file. 
						This will be a list you come back to and keep adding shortcuts as you learn them.
						For instance, how do we get System.out.println to spit out without typing it all out?
						How about the "main" function for classes?

		>_02_HelloWorld
			_01_HelloWorld.java
				-> TODO: Figure out how to do a Hello World in Eclipse using Java.
				-> TODO: In that same file, figure out how to print Hello World to the console in a couple ways.
							Example console output:   
									#1 Hello World
									#2 Hello ->This will use a different method than #1.
									   World
